# skills-display-system

The skills display system implements percentage-based skill bars for visualizing team member professional capabilities.

## Core Data Structure
Skills are represented as name-percentage pairs:
- Problem-Solving Skills: 95%
- Networking Skills: 83%
- Leadership Skills: 90%

## Visualization Components
Location: aximo/templates/pages/team/teamDetails.html.twig

The template renders skill bars with:
1. Skill name label
2. Percentage value display
3. Visual progress bar filled to the corresponding percentage value

Importance Score: 20/100 
The skill visualization system provides basic domain-specific functionality for displaying professional competency levels, though implements a relatively standard progress bar pattern.
